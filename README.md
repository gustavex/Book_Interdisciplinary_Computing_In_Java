# Interdisciplinary Computing in Java Programming Language (Sun-Chong Wang[â†’link](https://www.amazon.com/Interdisciplinary-Computing-Programming-International-Engineering/dp/1402075138))

I am using the problems presented in this book to study Physics and HPC. In this repository i will mostly just upload the Java code included in the book (the code is not mine). I plan to write Python (and maybe C++) versions of the solutions in a different repository.

# Observations
Chapter 3 of the book is not reflected here since I plan to use different parallelization libraries (liken MPI) when aplicable.
