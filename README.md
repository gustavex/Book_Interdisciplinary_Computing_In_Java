# Interdisciplinary Computing in Java Programming Language (Sun-Chong Wang[â†’link](https://www.amazon.com/Interdisciplinary-Computing-Programming-International-Engineering/dp/1402075138))

I am using the problems presented in this book to study Physics and HPC. In this repository i will mostly just upload the Java code included in the book (the code is not mine). I plan to write Python (and maybe C++) versions of the solutions in a different repository.

# Chapters


**Part I Java Language**
```
1. Java Basics
2. Graphical and Interactive Java
3. High Performance Computing
```
**Part II Computing**
```
4. Simulated Annealing
5. Artificial Neural Network
6. General Algorithm
7. Monte Carlo Simulation
8. Molecular Dynamics
9. Cellular Automata
10. Path Integral
11. Data Fitting
12. Bayesian Analysis
13. Graphical Model
14. JNI Technology
```

# Observations
Chapter 3 of the book is not reflected here since I plan to use different parallelization libraries (liken MPI) when aplicable.
